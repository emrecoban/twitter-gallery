# Twitter Gallery

Twitter Gallery is an **open-source** MIT-licensed [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) application that allows you to easily browse and filter media files from Twitter users.

## The Problem

Twitter's built-in media tab is often cumbersome to use, and it lacks the ability to search within the media section alone. This limitation can be frustrating for users who primarily want to explore and view images without the distractions of other types of content. To address this issue, I have built Twitter Gallery.

## Features

With my app, you can effortlessly discover and filter media files shared by Twitter users. Here's what sets Twitter Gallery apart:

- **Streamlined Media Display:** I have reimagined the way media files are presented, providing a clean and intuitive interface focused solely on visual content. Say goodbye to clutter and distractions as you browse through beautiful images.
- **Multiple Columns:** Twitter Gallery optimizes screen space by displaying photos in multiple columns, allowing you to view more images at once. This efficient layout ensures you can explore media files more efficiently and enjoy a seamless browsing experience.
- **Enhanced Search Functionality:** My app empowers you to search specifically within the media section of Twitter. Easily find images related to your interests or discover captivating photography from your favorite users. Twitter Gallery takes the frustration out of media exploration.
